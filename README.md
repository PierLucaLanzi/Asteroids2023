# Asteroids2023
This repository contains the Asteroid projectâ€™s source developed during the laboratory for the 2023/2024 edition of the Video Game Design and Development course. The repository shows the structure of the final project submission, which consists of the following directories and materials.

- The directory with the source code must include all the assets (music, sound effects, graphics) and all the sources of the assets when available (PSD, AI, xcf, fbx, etc.).

- The directory **Executables** with the executables for the Web (**mandatory**) and at least one of the executables for the main desktop platforms (Windows or OSX). All executables should be built at least as FullHD (1920x1080).
 
- The directory **Images/Screenshots** must contain at least 7 screenshots of the game in 16:9 screen proportion with a resolution of at least 1920x1080

- The directory **Images/Icon** must contain the icon used on the Itch page (347x275 pixels).
  
- The directory **GameplayVideo** must contain an mp4 video, around 3-5 minutes long, that shows actual gameplay recorded using any screen capture software in mp4 format.
  
- The directory **Documents** must contain two documents:
   - The game description used on the itch.io page;
   - The last version of the game design document.


In this repository, we added directories containing reference material (screenshots, cabin logos) and the original assets (images, sounds, fonts) we downloaded from the Web. Students are free to add additional material in their final submission if they deem it useful.
